# File Size Validation

This project demonstrates how to validate the size of a selected file using JavaScript before allowing the file to be uploaded.

## Project Contents

- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the form for file selection.
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file that handles file size validation and displays relevant messages.
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the page (currently under development).

## Features

- **File Size Validation**: Validates the size of the selected file and displays an error message if the file exceeds the specified limit.
- **User Feedback**: Provides feedback to the user on the status of the file selection and upload process.

## Usage

1. Open `index.html` in a browser.
2. Select a file using the file input.
3. Click on "Select" to validate the file size.
4. If the file size is within the limit, a success message will be displayed. If the file size exceeds the limit, an error message will be displayed.
